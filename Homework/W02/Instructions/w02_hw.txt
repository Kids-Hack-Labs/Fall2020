Kids Hack Labs - Week 02 Homework
Create a number guessing game

1. Import the random module

2. Create an application main entry point function
2.1. Initialize the random number generator by "seeding" it
2.2. Create a variable to keep track of the number of
     guesses the user will be allowed
2.3. Create a variable to keep track of the number of
     guesses the user has already made
2.4. Create a variable to keep track of whether the user won
     the game
     (HINT: set it to False)
2.5. Generate a random integer from a range between 1 and 63
     and store it in a variable
2.6. While the user hasn't guessed the right number and hasn't
     used up all their guesses:
2.6.1. Collect user input and store it in a variable
       (HINT: convert the input into a number)
2.6.2. Increase the number of guesses tracker by one
2.6.3. Compare the user input with the random number generated
       before. Set the variable that tracks player victory to
       True if that's the case
2.6.4. If the user's guess is not correct, let them know
       whether their guess was higher or lower than the
       actual number
2.7. If the player won the game, let them know
2.8. If the player did not win the game, tell them what the
     target number was

3. Create the driver code: if the file is being run as the main
   module:
3.1. Call the app's main entry point function
