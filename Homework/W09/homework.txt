Kids Hack Labs - Senior - Fall 2020
Week 09 Homework

These instructions are going to be very generic on purpose.

This is intended as research, code analysis, and porting code practice.

Directions:

Research the website below to learn other types of collision detection.

NOTE: As you will note, the website provided contains JavaScript code.
      You will not be able to simply copy-and-paste the code into your
      project. You are expected to analyse the code and port it to
      Python using the logic contained in the website.

Copy the Week 09 code folder structure into a separate folder.

In the src folder, open the intro_screen.py file.

Change the paddle_bounce function to use rectangle-circle collision.
The website provided should provide enough ideas for you to perform
the conversion.
