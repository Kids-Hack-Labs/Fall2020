Week 04 Homework 1

1. Create a person class
1.1 Define an initializer that takes a person's name, age, height and weight.
    Set the class's attributes accordingly. Hint: use the International System
    of units when storing height and weight. It usually makes it easier to
    calculate things later on
    Set an attribute called can_drive based on the person's age
1.2 Define a greet function
    This function should output a greeting back to the user
1.3 Define a get_age function
    This function should output a person's name and age. 
    Ex.: "Bob is 14 years old."
1.4 Define a drive_home function
    This function should output a string indicating if the person can or cannot
    drive home. 
    Ex. "Bob cannot drive home."
1.5 Define a get_bmi function
    This function should calculate the person's Body Mass Index based on their
    height and weight.
    
2. Create five different people, and call their functions to find out their 
    ages, their BMI, and whether they can drive or not.
