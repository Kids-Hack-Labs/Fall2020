Instructions:

1. Open IDLE and create a new file. 
2. Save it in the proper folder with the name: week_01.py

3. Import the sys and pygame libraries

4. Create a cleanup function.
	This function should quit pygame and exit to the system

5. Create the main function:
5.1	initialize pygame
5.2	set the window size using pygame.display.set_mode() and store it in a variable
	***IMPORTANT*** -> the window must be resizable
5.3	create a variable to store the screen's new size (use the get_size() function)
5.4	set the window's title using pygame.display.set_caption()
5.5	create a variable to indicate that the app is runnning. Set it to True

5.6	while the app is running:
5.6.1		for each event in the event queue (retrieve it with pygame.event.get()):
5.6.1.1			if the event is of type pygame.QUIT:
5.6.1.1.1			set the variable that indicates that the app is running
				to False
5.6.1.2			if the event is of type pygame.WINDOWRESIZE:
5.6.1.2.1			set the new size variable to the event's size

5.6.2		if the new size doesn't match the screen's current size:
5.6.2.1			set the screen to the new size using pygame.display.set_mode()

5.6.3		fill the screen with a colour of your choice
5.6.4		swap the display buffer using pygame.display.flip()

5.6.5		call the cleanup function

5.7 Driver code: if the __name__ attribute of the current file is "__main__":
5.7.1	call the main function
