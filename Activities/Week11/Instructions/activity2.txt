Making changes to the game's start condition:

Open the ball.py file

In the Ball class's initializer:
    Add a launched attribute, set it to False
    

In the Ball's update method:
    Before moving the ball, check if it has been launched.
    
    NOTE: The movement code in the update function must now be indented
          inside the if statement. This means that the ball should only 
          move independently if it has already been launched.

Open the intro_screen.py file

In the IntroScreen class's update method:
    **After updating the ball and the paddle**
    if the ball is not launched:
        position the ball so that the ball's centerx attribute is
        the same as the paddle's centerx. The ball's bottom should be 
        sitting on top of the paddle's top.
        
        from pygame's locals, import the K_SPACE name
        from the engine's game_env module, import the Game class
        
        if the spacebar is pressed (use the Game.get_key(key) method
        to check whether the key is pressed):
            set the ball's launched attribute to True
