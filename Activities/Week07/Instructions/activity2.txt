Week 07 Activity 2

=>Inside the game_env.py file:
01. Between the class declaration and the initializer definition:
01.1. Create a keys static attribute and assign an empty tuple to it
01.2. Create a mouse_buttons static attribute and assign an empty tuple 
      to it
01.1. Create a mouse_prev attribute and assign an empty tuple to it
01.2. Create a mouse_pos static attribute and assign an empty tuple 
      to it

02. In the Game's initializer
    (After setting the screen, before setting self.is_running to True)
02.1. Set Game.keys to pygame.key.get_pressed()
02.2. Set Game.mouse_buttons to pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
02.3. Set Game.mouse_prev and Game.mouse_pos to pygame.mouse.get_pos()

03. In the process_events() method, include the following checks inside
    the for loop:
03.1. If the event's type is KEYDOWN or KEYUP:
03.1.1. Set Game.keys to pygame.key.get_pressed()
03.2. If the event's type is MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or MOUSEBUTTONUP:
03.2.1. Set Game.mouse_buttons to pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
03.2.2. Set Game.mouse_prev to Game.mouse_pos
03.2.3. Set Game.mouse_pos to pygame.mouse.get_pos()
03.3. If the event's type is MOUSEMOTION:
03.3.1. Set Game.mouse_prev to Game.mouse_pos
03.3.2. Set Game.mouse_pos to pygame.mouse.get_pos()

=> At the end of the file, create the necessary static methods to get
   the input variables:
05. get_keys() should return Game's static keys attribute
06. get_key(key) is a convenience method to return Game's keys[key]
07. get_mouse_buttons() should return Game's static mouse_buttons
    attribute
08. get_mouse_prev() should return Game's static mouse_prev attribute
09. get_mouse_pos() should return Game's static mouse_pos attribute
