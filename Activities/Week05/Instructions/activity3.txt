Week 05 code
Activity 3

Instructions:

01. Open IDLE and CREATE A NEW FILE named surf.py

02. Import the pygame library (no sys needed this time)
02.1. Optional: "convenience import" Surface and Color

03. Create an application main entry point

04. Initialize pygame

05. Create a Surface with a size of 256x256 pixels
05.0 (Optional) Store a (non-black) colour in a variable

06. Fill the Surface with a colour of your choosing.
    If you stored a colour in a variable in the previous
    step, use it to fill your Surface.
    note: DO NOT USE BLACK as a fill colour!

07. Using pygame.image.save, save the file as with
    the name "surf.jpg"

08. Using the pygame.draw.circle() function, draw a circle
    in the middle of the surface. The circle's colour 
    should be different than the surface's colour
    Optional: use the ~ operator on the colour variable
    to draw a circle with the complementary colour
    
09. Save the surface again; this time, with the name
    "circle.png"
    
10. Create the driver code, which should run your main
    function if the module is run
    
11. Run the module. Open your file explorer, navigate 
    to where your code is. Check for the two newly 
    created files
