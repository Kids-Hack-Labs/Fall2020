Kids Hack Labs - Senior - Fall 2020
Week 05 code
Activity 4

Instructions:

01. Open base_file.py in IDLE

Note: Convenience imports were already made, and coding
      areas are already marked in the file. To avoid
      bugs, do not touch code outside the designated
      coding areas.
        
02. In the first coding area:
02.1 Store a colour for the background in a variable
02.2 Create a surface with a size of 100x100 pixels and
     store it in a variable
02.3 Store the surface's rectangle information in a
     variable
02.4 Store a second colour for the rectangle in a
     variable

03. In the second coding area:
03.1 Fill the screen with the background colour created
     in step 2.1
03.2 Fill the shape with the colour created in step 02.4
03.3 Using nested for loops, draw a checkerboard pattern
     on the screen. It should have 6x6 squares, based
     on the size of the square create in step 02.2 and
     the screen size.
     HINT: Use the counter variables in the for loop to
           position the rectangle correctly on the screen
           before blitting it to the screen

CHALLENGES:
The code creates a resizable window, but the rectangles
do not change sizes. From here, two challenges are 
proposed:
CHALLENGE 1: Resize the rectangles
    In the challenge area:
    Resize the rectangles when the screen is resized, so
    that there is always a 6x6 checkerboard on the screen
CHALLENGE 2: Expand the grid
    In the second coding area:
    Modify the for loop so that it accounts for the screen
    size when drawing rectangles
CHALLENGE 3: Use different shapes
    In the first coding area:
    Instead of creating rectangles, draw circles on the
    surface and blit it onto the screen
