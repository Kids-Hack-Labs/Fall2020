Kids Hack Labs - Senior - Fall 2020
Week 12
Activity 1

Implementing game end conditions:

1. Copy the contents of Week11 folder into Week12
2. Navigate to the src folder and open the intro_screen.py file

In the IntroScreen class's initializer:

    Create three attributes to track down the game's end, whether the
    ball is out of the screen, and victory conditions. As they should 
    be booleans, all of them need to be set to False at the beginning
    of the game

    Create two attributes to store background colours that will
    indicate game win/loss to the player. Make sure that they are 
    different from the background's "regular" colour.

At the end of the intro_screen.py file:
    Create a check_bricks() method.
        Create a variable to track no bricks left. Set it to True
        for each brick in the self.bricks attribute:
            if the brick is active:
                there are bricks left, so the tracking variable must be
                set to False
                As there is at least one brick left, there is no point
                in contiuning the loop, so break out of it
        return the tracking variable

In the IntroScreen's bound_ball() method:
    Change the LAST if statement to check whether the ball's top is 
    below the screen's bottom:
        set the "ball out" tracker variable to True

In the IntroScreen's update() method:
    Begin the method by setting the "game over" tracker to either a
    check of the bricks or to the "ball out" tracker
    if the game is over:
        set the "game won" tracker to the brick check
        as the game is over, the function should return at this point
        
In the IntroScreen's render() method:
    if the game is over:
        set the background colour to the adequate colour based on the
        win condition
