Week 04 Activity 2

1. Create a class called Animal
1.1	Define an initializer.
    This initializer should take three strings and a number, representing the
    animal's type (such as dog or cat), its name, number of legs it has,
    and what sound it makes
1.1.1 Set the animal's attributes accoring to the values passed in the
      initializer. (Hint: use the self keyword)
1.2 Define a walk function.
    For the number of legs that the animal has, it should print the string
    "step". For instance, a dog's walk would print "step" "step" "step" "step",
    whereas a duck would print "step" "step"
1.3 Define a make_sound function.
    This function should output the string that stores the animal's sound.
1.4 Define a get_name function.
    This function should print the animal's name in the format: 
    "The animal's name is " followed by the animal's name.
    
2. Create three different animals with different attributes and call their
    functions (walk(), make_sound() and get_name())
