***Using the project folder structure created in Activity 1***

1. Navigate to the engine folder and open the game_env.py file

=>Inside the game_env.py file:
=>Inside the Game class:

2. Define a run() method for the class:
2.1. The run() method contains the main loop; that is, the while loop
     that checks if the application is actually running. If it is:
2.1.1. Call the process_events() method
2.1.2. Call the update() method
2.1.3. Call the render() method
2.1.4. Set the delta attribute to the result of a call to the tick() 
       method of the clock attribute, using FPS as an argument
2.1.5. Set the time_since_started attribute to the result of a call
       to pygame.time.get_ticks()
2.2. Call the cleanup() method. Notice that this, if this code is
     inside the while loop, your game will run only once.

3. Define a cleanup() method for the class:
3.1. This method should call pygame.quit() and sys.exit()
