Week 06 Activity 3

***Using the project folder structure created in Activity 1***

1. Navigate to the engine folder and open the game_env.py file

=>Inside the game_env.py file:
=>Inside the Game class:

2. Define a process_events() method for the class
2.1. For every event in the event queue *retrieve it with pygame.event.get()*
2.1.1. If the event's type is pygame.QUIT:
2.1.1.1. Set te is_running attribute to False
(OPTIONAL steps if you made the window resizable in the previous activity)
2.1.2. If the event's type is pygame.VIDEORESIZE:
2.1.2.1. Set the screen_size attibute to the event's size
(End of optional part)

3. Define an update method for the class
3.1. The method should first check if the screen was resized.
3.1.1. If it was, the screen_surf attribute should be reassigned the value of
       pygame.display.set_mode() call, taking the screen_size attribute as
       an argument.
       (OPTIONAL: If you made the screen resizable in the previous activity,
        remember to make it resizable again)
3.1.2. Also considering that the screen may have been resized, call the 
       resize() method in our game_screen attribute, with screen_size as a
       parameter
3.2. Lastly, the method should call update() on the game_screen attribute

4. Define a render() method for the class:
4.1. This method should call the render method in our game_screen attribute
4.2. It should also call pygame.display.flip(), to finish the rendering cycle
