Week 08 Activity 2

=> In the src folder, create a paddle.py file

01. In the beginning of the file, import everything from pygame's locals, 
    as well as pygame's Color, Rect and Surface classes

02. Create a Paddle class. In its initializer:
02.1. Create a series of attributes for the paddle. Unlike the ball,
      we can get by with just a rect, a surf, a colour, and an x_vel
      attributes
      
      Suggestion:
      Create the rect first, and use the rect's size to create the 
      surface. Fill the surface with a colour, and set the rect's y 
      position (since the paddle shouldn't move vertically)

03. Create an update() method that takes delta_ms as an argument
03.1. Import the Game class from the engine folder's game_env module
03.2. Create left and right temporary variables to store the key presses
      to the left and the right
      
03.3. If the left key is pressed, subtract the rect's current centerx 
      position by x_vel * delta_ms. Remember to cast this into an integer

03.4. If the right key is pressed, add the rect's current centerx 
      position by x_vel * delta_ms. Remember to cast this into an integer
      
04. In the render() function:
04.1. Import the Game class from the engine's game_env module
04.2. Blit the paddle to the game's surface
