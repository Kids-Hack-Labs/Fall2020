Kids Hack Labs - Senior - Fall 2020
Week 08 Activity 1

01. Copy the folder structure from Week 07 into Week 08
01.1. Navigate to the engine folder and open the game_env.py file

=>Inside the game_env.py file:
02. Change the update() function definition to take delta_ms as an 
    argument.
02.1. At the end of the function, pass delta_ms to the Game.level's 
      update() method

03. Locate the Game's run() method. Inside it, pass self.delta as a 
    parameter to the game's update() method
    
=> Navigate to the intro_screen.py file
04. Change the update() function definition to take delta_ms as an 
    argument.

=> In the src folder, create a ball.py file. In this file:
05. Import the Color, Rect and Surface classes from pygame

06. Create a Ball class. Inside its initializer:
06.1. Create a series of attributes for the ball: radius, size, colour, 
      surf, rect and vel
            
      Remember to use the self keyword and make sure all the types
      match their use (ex: ball_radius is expected to be an integer,
      ball_size is supposed to be a tuple, and so on). Also, we will
      need to import pygame's draw module to be able to draw a circle
      onto the surface
      
      NOTE: If you do not remember how to use these attributes, Week 05 
      has pointers on what we are going to do
      
      OPTIONAL: Use colorkeys instead of alpha values for the surface.
                This technique makes the surface quicker to blit
      
07. Create an update() method that takes delta_ms as an argument:
07.1. Move the ball by adding its (velocity * delta_ms) to its position

08. Create a render() method:
08.1. Import the Game class from the engine's game_env module
08.2. Get the game's surface and blit the ball to the screen

=> Go back to the intro_screen.py file.
09. At the beginning of the file (after the pygame imports), 
    import the Ball class from the soruce's ball module

10. In the IntroScreen's initializer:
10.1 Create a Ball-type attribute 
     (NOTE: Remember to use the self keyword)

11. In the IntroScreen's update() method:
11.1. Call the update() function on the ball attribute. Remember to 
      pass the delta_ms parameter to the ball.

12. In the IntroScreen's render() mehtod:
12.1. Call the render() function on the ball attribute. Do it after 
      filling the screen
